# Privacy Policy for Mr. Thomas

**Last updated:** October 19, 2025

Mr. Thomas is a **Discord bot** that provides daily polls.

This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and what rights you have under the **EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**.

## 1. Data Controllers

The data controllers responsible for processing your data are:

**Developers:**
- **Ugur** (Discord: ugur._.)
- **Cali** (Discord: my_name_is_i_speak_arabic_only)

Both developers jointly manage the bot and its data handling in compliance with the GDPR.

## 2. Data We Collect

When you use the bot, we collect and store the following data, which is necessary to provide the poll service:

- **Discord User IDs** (of users who submit or review polls, used for identification and poll tracking).
- **Discord Usernames** (used only to display poll creators/reviewers in the `/pollList` command).
- **Poll content** (titles and options submitted through `/polls`).
- **Discord Channel IDs and Message IDs** (to send, track, and manage active polls).
- **Poll status** (e.g., active, declined, approved, used for history and management).

We do **not** collect or store private messages, voice data, or any content outside the explicit poll submission and management system.

---

## 3. Purpose and Legal Basis for Processing

We process this data solely for the following purposes:

- **Provide the botâ€™s features:** Poll creation, review, voting, and management.
- **Service Communication:** Sending notifications to users (e.g., when a poll is approved or declined).
- **Display and Management:** Storing and displaying poll history and lists.

### Legal Basis (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR):
Our **legitimate interest** in providing and continually improving the bot's functionality and user experience. We limit the processing to data strictly necessary for the service and ensure it doesn't override the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

---

## 4. Data Storage, Security, and Sub-Processors

All collected data is stored in a **MongoDB database**.

- **Hosting Environment:** The bot's code and its MongoDB database are hosted with a third-party service provider.
- **Access:** Access is strictly restricted to the bot's code and the data controllers (the developers).
- **Security:** We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure your data is protected against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse, including **password protection** and **access control** on the database.
- **Third Parties:** No data is shared with or sold to other third parties.

---

## 5. Data Retention and Deletion

We store your data (User IDs, Poll content, etc.) **indefinitely** to ensure the persistent availability of poll history and management features, **even if you leave the Discord server**.

However, you may request the deletion of your data (e.g., all your submitted polls and related user information) at any time.

Your data will be permanently deleted from our system within **7 days** of receiving a verified deletion request.
